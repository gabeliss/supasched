# Appointment Management

## Overview

The Appointment Management feature allows therapists to manually create, edit, or delete client appointments. Appointments are time-bound and tied to a specific therapist and client. They are validated against therapist availability, time-off, and existing appointments. This feature also enables clients to view their upcoming appointments and request changes (covered in a separate client-facing spec).

## UI/UX Breakdown

### **Therapist Dashboard - Appointment Management**

- Appointments appear as blocks in both Weekly and Monthly Calendar views.
- Therapists can:

  - Click `+ Add Appointment` button to open the **Appointment Modal**
  - Click any time slot directly in calendar to prefill time in the modal
  - Click existing appointment to open **Edit/Delete modal**

- **Conflict Handling:**

  - UI checks availability and time-off before submitting.
  - Backend performs final validation.
  - If conflict: Modal shows warning and disables submission.
  - Therapists may override for edge cases by checking a confirmation box (e.g., emergency session).

- **Recurring Appointment Support**: Not in MVP. All appointments are one-time.

- **Visual Priority:**
  - Appointments are rendered above availability and time-off blocks.
  - Show status (e.g., pending = dotted border, cancelled = strikethrough, confirmed = solid).

## Reusable Components & Logic

- **Appointment Modal**: Shared form for creating/editing. Reuses time & date pickers.
- **Conflict Checker**: Ensures time doesnâ€™t overlap with other blocks.
- **Appointment Renderer**: Draws appointment blocks in calendar.
- **Status Badge**: Displays appointment status visually.
- **Validation Schema**: Shared form validation rules.
