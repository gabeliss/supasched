# Client Booking Flow

## Overview

The client booking flow allows prospective clients to schedule sessions directly through an embeddable widget placed on a therapist's website. The widget pulls real-time availability and submits appointment requests to the therapist for approval.

This document also includes how therapists access and preview their widget for setup.
